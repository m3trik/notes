IMPORTING/EXPORTING
>	put UV seams on hard edges (harden all UV edge script)

>	
	
//zbrush:
>	define polygroups for UV seams

>	merge subtools for UV map

>	Work on clone

>	optional: UV Map border: lowest without tearing (tool:UV Map:UV Map border)
>	optional: polygroups: select to seperate UV islands by Polygroups (zPlugin:UV Master:Polygroups)
>	optional: Symmetry: select to make the UV islands symmetrical

>	use control painting to suggest UV seam locations

>	optional: use density painting to multiply or divide the density or an area (1 essentially acts as an eraser)

>	apply checker map texture to check uniformity

>	copy & paste to original model

//maya:
>	adding a suffix in order to enable Painter to recognise them. In our case, GUN_001_LOW will match with GUN_001_HIGH. Following the same example, if you need to bake multiple HD meshes on one single LP mesh, you’ll find that GUN_001_LOW matches GUN_001_HIGH_Part1, GUN_001_HIGH_Part2 and so on.







UV PLACEMENT
//maya
place3dTexture node (world space)


//vray
tri-planar projection



splitting material maps to separate uv spaces:
//maya
using place2dTexture node (UV space)
>	set UV wrap off on the directions you don't want wrapping into other maps uv space
>	move corresponding uv's to separate uv space
>	set translate frame in place2dTexture to correspond with maps intended uv space (ie. 1,0)
