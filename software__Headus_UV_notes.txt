quick start:

UV/3D views.......1/2/3
Split Pane........GUI/Display/Split Pane

procedures::

	 
Copy UV's and Stack -using custom mapped f1 and f2 keys:  (there is also a stacking tool GUI>Snap/Stack>Stack if UV's have already been copied)
	Copy UV's and stack-
		[F1] (GUI>Edit>Copy UV's).
		hit = (find same) to isolate identical shells (work area menu populates after initally hitting F1 (copy uv's in GUI))
		hit ] or [ to move shells to corner of UV space & home key to frame
		LMB select an edge on the original and then same edge on shells to copy to.
		hit space to stack.
	Stack Using grid snap-
		turn on grid. GUI>snap/stack>'|' GUI>snap/stack>'-'
		Space + MMB drag shells on top of each other. 
	Box-
		Marquee select the stacked shells
		[F2] GUI>Pack>New Box
		lock box. 'L' hotkey then 'LMB'
		delete box by mouse over and using 'delete' key
	Lock-
		With shells selected hit 'L' to toggle shell lock.
		**to lock all shells; hit L with the mouse cursor outside and LMB drag select shells. (RMB drag to un-lock all shells)
		


Flatten all shells:
	hit f or shift+f, then after the prompt; LMB drag a box around the shells to flatten


Drop/unDrop all shells with d /shft+d
	(if not working try LMB drag method above)

Optimize all shells:
	LMB drag select shells
	GUI>Optimize>Run For (F6)


	
weld mesh all:
	hit shft+d in the UV space and marquee over the shells to send them back to the edit window
	in the edit window, hit shift+d again in an empty space and marquee over the shells to weld 

	
	
straighten edge:
	using grid-
		turn on grid. GUI>snap/stack>| GUI>snap/stack>-
		drag align two end points of edge to straighten. 'MMB + ctrl' (or shft) drag
		**to move points without MMB. Edit>Settings>No MMB
		
	using anchor points-
		turn on anchors GUI>Snap/Stack>- (first icon in U and V direction)
		after positioning a point hit 'A' to set as anchor
		mouse over the anchors and hit 'S' to set the border to straighten.
		double tap 'S' (or 'shft+S') on canvas to straighten edge.
		**turn anchors off. mouse over 'shft + A'
		**toggle pins. mouse over 'P' or 'shft + P'

	using K hotkey-
		select an edge(s) holding the 'K' hotkey.
		**select a point and hit 'K' to toggle Kink on that point and allow edges on each side to flatten independently.
		flatten shell.
	
square edges:
	using I hotkey-
		rotate UV shell into position.
		select edges holding the 'i' hotkey. deselect using 'Backspace'
		**Toggle select similarly oriented edges or clear all using 'ctrl + i'
		**Select edge loop using 'shft + i'
		perform operation by flattening the shell.
		
	Snap pipes and rectangles to axis aligned grid-
		if topology allows, snap quads to an axis aligned grid by hitting 'R' hotkey. (otherwise, snaps boundary to an axis aligned rectangle)
		**align internal UVs as well by hitting 'shft + R' when mouse pointer is aimed at shell boundary points.
