Camera notes:

Aperture
	Aperture is generally measured byF-Stop. Aperture also has a secondary effect of controlling the depth of field of an image.

Depth of field
	describes how much of an image is in focus from front to back. Depth of field is controlled by the aperture as well as the lens magnification.









Lighting notes:



types and definitions:
Key		gives depth to your render
Rim		brings out the silhouette
Fill	reveal all the details of your textures



Terms:
IBL		Image based lighting.
LUT		Look up tables.
Depth of field	
Field of view	


Tips:
Make sure your scene or render is bright enough. Shadows, low-lit areas are still readable to the eye. 

Check your monitor settings for optimal lighting.

Don’t always stick to the first lighting setup. It can be helpful to try a few different scenarios (dawn, day, dusk, night).

Avoid using just HDR lighting and light your model using three main lights: 
	a rim light, which brings out the silhouette; 
	a key light, which gives depth to your render;
	a fill light to reveal all the details of your textures.
	Now switch back on your HDR, which will improve your reflections.
	
	
BAKED LIGHTING SETUP
//unreal
>	deactivate auto exposure
>	deactivate SSAO and SSR
>	keep default tone mapper
>	vignetting = off
>	bloom = off


normalize lighting color values.
with color picker check to see that the in engine lit material has the same value. in this case .5 sRGB.
- setup chrome sphere
	base color =1
	metallic =1
	roughness =0
- setup grey sphere
	base color =.5 sRGB (linear =.18)
	roughness =
- directional light set at 3.14
	


lighting build 	quality
>	build> lighting quality> preview-med-high-production	(high influence on build time)

world settings
>	static lighting level scale	  reduce to pick up detail at the cost of more noise	(medium influence on build time)
>	num indirect lighting bounce  3-5		(low influence on build time)
>	indirect lighting smoothness  .7-1		(low influence on bulid time)
>	light sample placement scale  			

static lighting level scale * indirect lighting quality = 1.  ie. .01 x10  or .02 x5  or .5 x2

for windows /doorways,  use portal



lightmaps:
//unreal
>	save all lighting information in a sub-level
>	convert the sub-level into a lighting scenario



DYNAMIC LIGHTING SETUP
//unreal
>	direction light =moveable
>	skydome =moveable
>	distance field ambient occlusion
>	screen space ambient occlusion

activate 'generate mesh distance fields'
>	project editor> lighting> generate mesh distance fields
avoid non uniform scaling
large objects will have poor distance field resolution





IMAGE BASED LIGHTING SETUP
>	geometry to cast and recieve shadows
>	back plate
>	directional light (moveable)
>	skylight with hrdi (moveable)
>	fake movement shadows (bluepint image that follows the object) (used due to memory restrictions)





AREA OF EFFECT:
//unreal
lightmass importance volume		specify area in which to concentrate lighting recources.







SHADOWS:
//unreal
-fix artifacts by pushing the map into the geometry.
-set shadow map bias low for small objects to prevent light leaking.


-large scene objects us cascade shadows (shadow lod)

-even larger use raytraced distance field shadows

-overcast scene: increase lighting source angle to soften shadow







REFLECTIONS:
//unreal
high resolution reflection capture (memory intensive)






POST PROCESSING:
//unreal
postprocessvolume class.	area effected by user defined post processing.
