Deformation:        deform entire geometry
\unify
   The Unify button changes the dimensions of the current 3D tool. The object’s height, width, and/or depth are changed to a unit size which fits neatly inside the Object Preview window.
   As with most items in the Deformation sub-palette, you can constrain this button’s effect along the X, Y and/or Z axes by first pressing the corresponding letter within this button.
\mirror
   The Mirror button flips the current 3D tool so it becomes a mirror-image reflection of itself. As with most items in the Deformation sub-palette, you can constrain this button’s effect along the X, Y and/or Z axes by first pressing the corresponding letter within this button.
\smart resym
   deformation\smart reSym averages symmetry by default.  to mirror from one side without effecting the origional mask it off.
   The Smart Realign Symmetry button restores symmetry to the object by examining all points in the mesh from beginning to end and determining which were originally intended to lie in mirror-symmetrical positions.
   This button can be used on a mesh which was originally created with mirror symmetry, whether created in ZBrush or imported from another source, even if large-scale distortion has occurred.
   You can ‘lock’ one side of an object by masking it before pressing this button; the opposite side then becomes adjusted to mirror the masked side. This is a good way to perform sculpting actions on one side of a mesh (which don’t change the polygon count), as with Projection Master, then reflect them on the opposite side.
   Select one or more axes for this action by clicking the small X, Y and Z modifers to turn them on (light) or off (dark).
\resym
   The Realign Symmetry button restores mirror symmetry to the object by adjusting the positions of vertices which lie in near-symmetrical positions. With symmetry restored, the object can be edited using mirror-symmetry modes in the Transform palette.
   Depending on the amount of distortion which has occurred, the vertices found in near-symmetrical positions may not necessarily be those originally intended to be symmetrical. For more sophisticated symmetry-realigning, use the Smart Resym button.
   Select one or more axes for this action by clicking the small X, Y and Z modifers to turn them on (light) or off (dark).
\polish 
   The Polish slider will control the strength of Polish being applied. The icon on the right will determine the polish mode that will be calculated. To change the polish mode click on the circle.
       Open Circle will apply a polish that will maintain the overall form of the tool.
       Closed Circle will apply a polish that will smooth out the tool without maintaining the volume.
\Polish by Features
   Polish By Features will evaluate the mesh’s creased edges and polyGroups. ZBrush will polish the whole surface while maintaining PolyGroup borders or creased edges. With the small circle closed, ZBrush will maintain the overall shape and vol­ume of the mesh without shrinking.
       With the small circle open, ZBrush will use more aggressive smoothing. You will see some surface volume changed.
\Polish by Groups
   The Polish By Groups slider will polish the surface based on polygrouping. All polygroups edges will be smoothed.
       This powerful feature has a modifier setting in the form of a small circle. With the circle closed, ZBrush will maintain the overall volume of the mesh while polishing based on the surface’s PolyGroup borders. If the circle is open ZBrush will still polish based on PolyGroup border but the overall volume will not be maintained and the mesh will likely contract.
\Polish Crisp Edges
   The Polish Crisp Edges slider will polish the surface based on creasing. All areas surrounded by creases will be smoothed. This powerful feature has a modifier setting in the form of a small circle. With the circle closed, ZBrush will maintain the overall volume of the mesh while polishing based on Creased Edges. If the circle is open ZBrush will still polish based on Creased Edges but the overall volume will not be maintained.
\Relax
   The Relax slider will relax the geometry of a mesh to it original state but still maintain sculptural detail.
       Open Circle will apply a polish that will maintain the overall form of the tool.
       Closed Circle will apply a polish that will smooth out the tool without maintaining the volume.
\SBend
   The Smooth Bend slider bends the object around the selected axis or axes, in a smoothly-curved manner. Polygons on one side of the object are expanded, and polygons on the opposite side are compressed.
\SSkew
   The Smooth Skew slider displaces polygons in the direction of the selected axis or axes. Polygons on either side of the centerline are skewed in a smoothly-curved manner.
\RFlatten
   The Radial Flatten slider creates cylindrical faces on the object, around the selected axis or axes. It does this by adjusting all polygons which lie beyond the specified radius so they lie against this cylindrical face. It doesn’t change the number of polygons which compose the object.
   Positive or negative values determine whether polygons are flattened inward toward the center of the object, or outward from the center.
\Flatten
   Positive or negative values determine which side of the object is affected. For example, when flattening along the X axis, a positive value creates a flat face on the object’s left side; a negative value creats a flat face on the object’s right side.
\SFlatten
   The Spherical Flatten slider creates spherical faces on the object, around the selected axis or axes. It does this by adjusting all polygons which lie beyond the specified radius so they lie against this spherical face. It doesn’t change the number of polygons which compose the object.
   Positive or negative values determine whether polygons are flattened inward toward the center of the object, or outward from the center.
\Smooth
   the mesh can be roughened by setting this slider to a negative value.

zbrush tips:

: Saving masks
I often need to save masking selections, for quick isolations when PolyPainting, for example. For this I create several PolyPaint Layers, each in grayscale so I can later Mask by Intensity. You can only have one polygroups set, but you can have as many layers as you want…


: Creating ZRemesherGuide loops
You want your joints in a specific place, so you create guide loops with ZRemesherGuide brush. The best way of doing this is with CreaseCurve brush. Turn ON PolyF to see the wire frame, and then use CreaseCurve. When you're finished, under the Stroke menu > Curve Functions, simply deactivate the Border and Frame Mesh options. Easy as that!


: Creating holes
With the SliceCircle brush, create a new polygroup for the hole, then hide and delete that polygroup. Bridge two openings using CurveBridge brush and re-DynaMesh the object. Don't forget that when using the CurveBridge brush, press Shift to have it automatically draw/close the guide on the opening.
