Camera notes:





Exposure:
	The amount of light that reaches the camera sensor. Exposure Value is simply a way to combine shutter speed and aperture to a single value.
	
	overcast: ~10
	sunset: ~8
	bright interior: ~6
	night w/artificial lighting: ~2
	dark interior: ~1

	Shutter Speed:
		How long the camera will take to absorb the light.


	Aperture:
		How wide the opening of the lense will be. Aperture is generally measured byF-Stop. Aperture also has a secondary effect of controlling the depth of field of an image.


	Sensitivity:
		ISO value. How reactive the camera sensor is to light.
	

	
	
	
Depth of field:
	describes how much of an image is in focus from front to back. Depth of field is controlled by the aperture as well as the lens magnification.
