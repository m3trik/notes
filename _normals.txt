//general:
>	On a low res mesh, either use a single smoothing group with more geometry to avoid unsightly gradients in your normal maps at lower texture resolutions, Or Multiple smoothing groups, but only on hard edges.

>	to prevent artifacting with models with seperate geometry, select match> 'by mesh name' (and make sure the low and high poly model's parts are named the same)

>	use suffix naming convention on both high and low meshes parts so that the sofware can process them seperately 

>	select high definition mesh

>	adjust the distance needed for projection

>	higher antialising sampling will add to baking time



//Zbrush
>	Set subD to lowest division

>	optional: select flipG (green rgb) in some cases (unity)

>	Hit create map

>	Clone normal map and export texture
