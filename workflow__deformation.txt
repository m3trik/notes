-----	bend & lattice	

//ZBrush:

Bend w/ Transpose tool
>   In Move mode apply an Action line across the bend axis. Hold the ALT key and drag the Action Line’s center circle to bend surface.  (other deformation effects are possible by holding alt in scale and rotate) 

Bend to surface w/ Match Maker
>   brush pallet:Match Maker  Can set plane as deformation guide.  Geometry conforming to must be on seperate layer.   Subdivide as necessary.

Bend w/ Move Topological Brush
>   brush pallet:Move topological
 
Bend w/ Deformation Pallet
>   set pivot /Transform from pivot point. 



//Maya:

Bend Deformer
>	Select the object(s) you want to deform.
>	Select Deform > (Create) Nonlinear > Bend > .
>	The Bend Options window appears.

>	Click the Basic and Advanced tabs and set the creation options.
>	See Bend Options and Advanced deformer options.

(Optional) As you set the creation options, you can also do either of the following:
>	Select Edit > Save Settings to save the creation options and keep the options window open.
>	Select Edit > Reset Settings to reset the options to their default and keep the options window open.
>	Click Create to create a bend deformer and close the options window.
>	(Click Apply to create a bend deformer and keep the options window open.)
A bend deformer handle displays in the scene and its nodes are listed in the Channel Box. The nodes include the bend handle node (default name: bendnHandle), the bend handle shape node (bendnHandleShape), and the bend deformer node (default name: bendn).

To create bend deformation effects
>	Manipulate the bend deformer handle.
>	Edit bend deformer channels and attributes (see Edit bend nonlinear deformers) or paint nonlinear deformer weights to adjust the deformation effect.

lattice deformer
>   Select one or more deformable objects.
>   Select Deform > (Create) Lattice > .
>   The Lattice Options window appears.

>   Click the Basic and Advanced tabs and set the creation options.
>   See Deform > (Create) Lattice and Advanced deformer options.

>   (Optional) As you set the creation options, you can also do the following:
>   Select Edit > Save Settings to save the creation options and keep the options window open.
>   Select Edit > Reset Settings to reset the options to their default and keep the options window open.
>   Do one of the following:
>   Click Create to create a lattice deformer. The options window closes.
>   Click Apply to create a lattice deformer and keep the options window open.
>   Click Close to close the Lattice Options window.

To create lattice deformation effects
>   Move, rotate, or scale influence lattice points.
>   Edit lattice deformer channels and attributes.
