MATERIAL CREATION:
world aligned texture:
//unreal
>	create a worldAlignedTexture node.
>	convert the bitmap/normal map to a 'Texture Object' and plug it into the worldAlignedTexture 'TextureObject' input. (right click 'Texture Sample' and Convert to texture object)
>	create a size node and plug it into the worldAlignedTexture TextureSize input.
>	connect the XYZ texture output of the worldAlignedTexture node to the base materials 'base color' input.




	

EMISSIVE:
//unreal:
>	create material and double click to open the material editor
>	create a constant(float)(name it emission), a constant3vector(name it color), and a plug those into a multiply node
>	plug the multiply node into the materiat emmisive color slot
>	close out the material editor, right click the material and create a new instance.
>	




PROCEDURAL:

//Procedural tiling of bitmaps: (This will only work for relatively uniform textures, not for those with repetitive patterns, such as bricks, planks or tiles.)

>	make a copy of your bitmap in the Material Editor
>	offset it in both axes by a random value
>	plug these two bitmaps in a Composite or Mix map
>	take a Noise map with fractals on and use the RGB curve to clamp it to just black and white (it will look like a cow hide).
>	Now you can use this Noise map as a mask to mix your two bitmaps, introducing chaos in the tiling – though you’ll need a high value for the scale of the Noise.
