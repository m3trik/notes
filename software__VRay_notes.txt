MATERIAL_PROPERTIES:____________________________________________________
//VRay:

general:
Reflection		Think of reflections as a layer on top of diffuse color.
				(If the material has 0% reflections, it shows 100% of the Diffuse color. If the material has 30% reflections, the Diffuse color is weakened to just 70%, and so on.)
				
Glossiness		almost never below 0.3.

H.Glossiness	locked
R.Glossiness	under .98 - plug in dust/speckle/fingerprint maps

Reflection IOR	should be locked to Refraction IOR.
				(All real life materials have the same reflection IOR and refraction IOR.)

IOR				Default: 1.52
				Water: 1.33
				Plastic: 1.45
				Glass: 1.5 – 1.8
				Diamond: 2.4
				Leather: 3.5
				Compound materials like wood, stone, concrete etc.: 3 – 6
				Metals: 18-100 (Though you should rarely exceed 40)
			
Fresnel			on and unlocked - spread of reflection across the surface 
				depending on viewing angle.
				(In real life, light will reflect differently from different angles.)
				polished wood - 18-50 (entire surface is reflective)
				wood/leather  - 4-6 (more reflective at grazing angles)

BDRF			Microfacet GTR(GGX) - 1.6-2.2 softness of highlight across surface.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Plastic (generic):
	Plastic, being a softer material, will show surface wear more than glass would, so bump maps and R.Glossiness maps would be slightly more noticable.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Glass (generic):
>	Set reflection to 98% black (if you need less reflection, reduce the IOR)
>	Set reflection glossiness to .98-1.0
	Add a grunge map to the R.Gloss slot and set it’s strength to 10. We want the effect to be subtle and just enough to break up the highlights.
	Fresnel Reflection values stay on and locked at the defaults.
>	Set refraction to 98-100% white
	This is controlling how transparent the object is. Color if needed.
>	Set refraction glossiness to 1.0 Controls the clarity of the refraction.
>	IOR 1.54 (1.4 acryllic.  1.6-1.8 flint)
	IOR is controlling how the light bends as it passes through. A higher refraction IOR will bend light more, causing the image through the glass to be more distorted and bent. 
>	Check "Affect Shadows" option ON under refraction parameters.
>	Optional: Set the glass color via Fog Color parameter under Refraction options.

>	Falloff map plugged into the reflect slot. (slight negative bezier start with overall slight positive curve. black-white)

>	Scaled procedural noise to the bump map with a low value to give the glass that subtle imperfection in the refractions and add to the overall realism in the material.



Hollow Glass:
>	use a shell modifier on the geometry.	https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/3DSMax/files/GUID-E38BD284-3283-4311-AC29-3F699B2F04AA-htm.html



Tinted Glass:
	The accurate way to colorize a glass material is by using Fog Color because it renders the thinner parts lighter and thicker parts darker. 
>	Fog Multiplier changes the strength of the tint.
>	Fog Bias negative values make the thin parts of the objects more transparent and the thicker parts more opaque and vice-versa (positive numbers make thinner parts more opaque and thicker parts more transparent).
>	Refract Color can be used to colorize glass using bitmaps or procedurals for less accurate results.



Frosted Glass:
>	Refract Glossiness around .5
>	Reflection Glossiness would be .6 to blur the refraction but still allow light through.



Crystal Glass:
>	Diffuse color Black (Value: 1)
>	Reflection color 220 (Almost white).
>	RGlossiness .99.
>	RGlossiness map with fingerprints, smudges, scratches, nicks, etc.
>	Refraction color 230* (Almost white)
>	Glossiness 1.0.
>	Check ‘Affect shadows’.
>	Check ‘Abbe number’.
>	Abbe value 20.0 (lower is more dispersion and longer render times).
>	IOR 1.9.
>	Max depth 12.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Nodes_________________________________________________________


vray dirt:
 Adding VRayDirt to a material will add render to render times. So you want to use as few dirt nodes as possible to avoid this. Some tricks to increasing the intensity of a VRayDirt is to add one instance several times into a a Composite node with each of the blends sent to “Multiply”.

VRayDirt Parameters:

Radius:						Determines the spread of coverage where dirt is produced.
Occluded Color: 			The color/map that is acting as your dirt.
Unoccluded Color:			The color/map that is the overall surface.
Distribution: 				Forces the dirt effect into or away from contact areas.
Falloff: 					Controls the spread from occluded to unoccluded areas.
Subdivs: 					Controls the quality of the dirt effect (adds to render time).
Bias: 						Forces the dirt effect in those directions (negative inverts).
Ignore for GI: 				Lets you see dirt effect in light cache renders.
Consider same object only: 	When checked, dirt will NOT collect around areas where separate objects touch. By default this is off.
Double-Sided: 				Creates and effect where edges and creavase are occluded.
Invert Normal: 				Reverses direction of dirt placement. When off, dirt sits in crevices, when on dirt will render at the open corners/edges.
Work with transparency: 	Takes into account object opacity.


A. Ambient Occlusion with Dirt:

	starting values:
		Radius 0.5”
		Distribution -50
		Falloff 0.2
		Radius Mapped where noted
	
	>	create a composite node and add 2-4 layers to it. (This is going to let us 
		blend the dirt pass with the objects diffuse, but also increase the intensity of the dirt effect using blend modes (set to multiply) without using additional VRayDirt nodes).

	>	layer1 - diffuse, vrayDirt - layer2, layer3, layer4.

	>	grunge bitmap and noise to a mix map. which is plugged into the vrayDirt radius.
		(When you add a map to the radius of a VRayDirt node it acts as a mask and creates a more random, realistic wear to the surface)



B. Masking Corners with Dirt:

	starting values:
		Radius .5”
		Distribution -100
		Falloff .15
		Invert Normal – Checked

	>	Create a composite node and add 4 layers to it

	>	Set layers 2, 3 and 4 to multiply

	>	Plug your dirt map into all 4 slots

	>	Connect that into the Blend 1 slot of the VRayBlendMtl

	>	Next create a cellular map with the following values under Cell Characteristics:
			Chips
			Size .2
			Spread .5
		
	>	Plug that into the radius of your dirt and render. You’ll now have a chipped effect going across the edges of your object.


C. Using Multiple Dirt Maps

	In a duplicated dirt use these values:
		Radius 6”
		Distribution 1
		Falloff .25
		Bias -50 in Z

	Create a smoke map and use these values:
		Size 2
		Iterations 8
		Exponent 2

	Use the smoke in the new dirts radius and create a new composite node that has 2 layers with layer 2 set to multiply blend mode.

	This is an easy way to create complex looking edge wear with just 2 procedural materials and some use of composite nodes to increase intensity and variation across.

	>	Create a new composite node with 2 layers and plug the composite node from the cellular setup into layer 1

	>	Plug the smoke setup in layer 2 of the new composite and set the blend to multiply

	>	Plug the cellular and smoke maps into the masks for layers 2 and 3 on the opposite composite nodes

	>	Plug the new composite node into the blend 1 slot of our material.

Modifiers_____________________________________________________


VRayDisplacementModifier:

>	connect greyscale texture to an output node. then to the Texmap slot of the Displacement Modifier.



Type:
	These are different ways that the displacement is calculated. Generally, you should only use 3D Mapping.

Texmap/Texture chan/Filter texmap/Filter blur:
	These control the texture image that is used for the displacement. You already know what the Texmap box is for. Texture chan determines which UV channel is used for the Texmap. Filter texmap allows you add a small amount of blur and smoothing to the image (controllable with Filter Blur) to smooth out any super-sharp details. Generally, you can check the Filter box and leave it at the default of .001 if you are using a good map for your displacement.

Amount:
	The amount the displacement pushes out in real-world units.

Shift:
	You may notice that your displacement will tend to “puff out” the entire model. This is because displacement will take the surface geometry and move them outwards according to the value set in the Amount. If your texture is mostly white, this means that your model can grow in size infinitely depending on what value you set!

	We often see rugs get eaten up by a floor if the floor’s displacement value is set too high – again, because the surface is being moved outwards.

	To combat this, we can use the Shift value. What this basically does is “move” the surface inwards before starting the displacement, thus limiting the maximum height of the final displaced surface. See the graphic below and watch this video.

Water Level:
	Water level will cut off everything below the value. For example, if you set the amount to 1 and the water level to .5, any low-lying geometry will be culled from the render. You can easily make your model disappear if you set this too high! For example in the render below, the Amount is set to 1 but the water level is set to .5 – so everything from 0 to half an inch is just removed.

Relative to bbox:
	This will change the way Max calculates the displacement heights. Leave it unchecked.

Texmap min/max:
	These are useful when using a 16-bit texture as it will allow black to actually displace inwards, grey to be 0, and white to displace outwards. Generally, however we do not use this functionality. If you would like to learn more, watch this Youtube video. Basically when you generate a 16-bit texture, some of the values will actually be negative. These min/max values act as clamps on that value – so if you have a black value of -5 in your texture, then you can set -5 as the minimum value here and it will allow that negative value to act as a displacement. We rarely work with 16 bit textures and this option doesn’t work with procedural textures.

Edge length:
	Earlier we explained how displacement will automatically subdivide geometry to add more edges. The amount of edges that are added are controlled using this number. If you are getting artifacts or a polygonal look to your displacement, increase this value. It measures the maximum amount of pixels an edge is allowed to occupy before it is subdivided into a smaller triangle. The smaller the number, the more subdivided the model gets.

View-dependant:
	When checked, the above explanation works. When unchecked, Edge length is in world units instead instead of pixels. So a value of 1 in the Edge length becomes 1 inch before the edge is subdivided again. Generally, you should keep it on.

Keep continuity:
	This is a very important checkbox, but it’s off by default. When a displacement rounds a corner, it can displace the two surfaces on either side of the corner away from each other, creating a gap that will appear in the render as a black area. Enabling this option will make sure that your edges stay together! In the images below you can see when this is disabled (left) vs. when it is enabled (right).

Edge thresh:
	This value controls the blending between different maps on different faces. Keep it low – generally you shouldn’t change it from the default
