freeze joint transforms:
>	hit ctrl+g without selecting anything (this will create an empty transform node called null1). 
>	point-snap this transform node at the same position as the joint you want to zero out.
>	make this null a child of the joint.
>	apply freeze transform. so that now, the null’s values are zero.
>	select this null and make it a child of the parent joint of the joint you want to zero out (that is, if you want to zero the heel joint, then make the null child of the knee joint).
>	select the joint, and make it a child of the null node.
this should give you zero values in the channel box of the joint.
