- VRay notes ---





MATERIALS:____________________________________________________
//VRay:

general:
Reflection		Think of reflections as a layer on top of diffuse color.
				(If the material has 0% reflections, it shows 100% of the Diffuse color. If the material has 30% reflections, the Diffuse color is weakened to just 70%, and so on.)
				
Glossiness		almost never below 0.3.

H.Glossiness	locked
R.Glossiness	under .98 - plug in dust/speckle/fingerprint maps

Reflection IOR	should be locked to Refraction IOR.
				(All real life materials have the same reflection IOR and refraction IOR.)

IOR				Default: 1.52
				Water: 1.33
				Plastic: 1.45
				Glass: 1.5 – 1.8
				Diamond: 2.4
				Leather: 3.5
				Compound materials like wood, stone, concrete etc.: 3 – 6
				Metals: 18-100 (Though you should rarely exceed 40)
			
Fresnel			on and unlocked - spread of reflection across the surface 
				depending on viewing angle.
				(In real life, light will reflect differently from different angles.)
				polished wood - 18-50 (entire surface is reflective)
				wood/leather  - 4-6 (more reflective at grazing angles)

BDRF			Microfacet GTR(GGX) - 1.6-2.2 softness of highlight across surface.

Nodes_________________________________________________________


vray dirt:
 Adding VRayDirt to a material will add render to render times. So you want to use as few dirt nodes as possible to avoid this. Some tricks to increasing the intensity of a VRayDirt is to add one instance several times into a a Composite node with each of the blends sent to “Multiply”.

VRayDirt Parameters:

Radius:						Determines the spread of coverage where dirt is produced.
Occluded Color: 			The color/map that is acting as your dirt.
Unoccluded Color:			The color/map that is the overall surface.
Distribution: 				Forces the dirt effect into or away from contact areas.
Falloff: 					Controls the spread from occluded to unoccluded areas.
Subdivs: 					Controls the quality of the dirt effect (adds to render time).
Bias: 						Forces the dirt effect in those directions (negative inverts).
Ignore for GI: 				Lets you see dirt effect in light cache renders.
Consider same object only: 	When checked, dirt will NOT collect around areas where separate objects touch. By default this is off.
Double-Sided: 				Creates and effect where edges and creavase are occluded.
Invert Normal: 				Reverses direction of dirt placement. When off, dirt sits in crevices, when on dirt will render at the open corners/edges.
Work with transparency: 	Takes into account object opacity.


A. Ambient Occlusion with Dirt:

	starting values:
		Radius 0.5”
		Distribution -50
		Falloff 0.2
		Radius Mapped where noted
	
	>	create a composite node and add 2-4 layers to it. (This is going to let us 
		blend the dirt pass with the objects diffuse, but also increase the intensity of the dirt effect using blend modes (set to multiply) without using additional VRayDirt nodes).

	>	layer1 - diffuse, vrayDirt - layer2, layer3, layer4.

	>	grunge bitmap and noise to a mix map. which is plugged into the vrayDirt radius.
		(When you add a map to the radius of a VRayDirt node it acts as a mask and creates a more random, realistic wear to the surface)



B. Masking Corners with Dirt:

	starting values:
		Radius .5”
		Distribution -100
		Falloff .15
		Invert Normal – Checked

	>	Create a composite node and add 4 layers to it

	>	Set layers 2, 3 and 4 to multiply

	>	Plug your dirt map into all 4 slots

	>	Connect that into the Blend 1 slot of the VRayBlendMtl

	>	Next create a cellular map with the following values under Cell Characteristics:
			Chips
			Size .2
			Spread .5
		
	>	Plug that into the radius of your dirt and render. You’ll now have a chipped effect going across the edges of your object.


C. Using Multiple Dirt Maps

	In a duplicated dirt use these values:
		Radius 6”
		Distribution 1
		Falloff .25
		Bias -50 in Z

	Create a smoke map and use these values:
		Size 2
		Iterations 8
		Exponent 2

	Use the smoke in the new dirts radius and create a new composite node that has 2 layers with layer 2 set to multiply blend mode.

	This is an easy way to create complex looking edge wear with just 2 procedural materials and some use of composite nodes to increase intensity and variation across.

	>	Create a new composite node with 2 layers and plug the composite node from the cellular setup into layer 1

	>	Plug the smoke setup in layer 2 of the new composite and set the blend to multiply

	>	Plug the cellular and smoke maps into the masks for layers 2 and 3 on the opposite composite nodes

	>	Plug the new composite node into the blend 1 slot of our material.
