	outer red rings      scale constrained by opposite end point
	center red ring      scale constrained by both end points




: rotate  (r key)
	outer red rings      rotate
	center red ring      twist 



: transpose perpendicular
>	click polygon to auto-draw transpose line from its normal




Pivot:

: center on selection
>	click white circle to center your selection pivot

>	deformation> mirror
>	geometry> modify topology> paste append



: re-sym
>	mask side to protect from change.
>	deformation> smart re-sym (to mirror one side to the next) averages both sides by default.











CURVES:    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


profile editor:  edit point curve type -drag a point off the editor and leaving the mouse button pressed move back onto the editor.



: Delete Curve
delete all curves:
>	Stroke> Curve Functions> Delete Curve

delete curve on surface:
>	With curve brush active, click on surface.




Add to Curve (ZModeler):
	generate a curve corresponding to the selected Target. The created curves can later be used with Curve Actions or other Curve brushes. 




	














EDIT TOPOLOGY:-----------------------------------------------------------------------


: Toggle Polyframe (mesh visability) (shft + f)




: Subdivide (ctrl + d)
	up subdivision level: (d)
	down subdivision level:	(shft + d)




: Smooth (shft)
also: alternative brush; smooth Directional

: Ultimate Smooth
>	hold shift to smooth
>	release shift while smoothing





: Un-Weld (ZModeler):
	disconnects the clicked edges corresponding to the Target and creates creasing on the border edges. Extruded polygons are created to keep the original shape visually separate when Dynamic Subdivision is enabled.




: Bridge Geometry
Using the curve brush:
>	Turn off symmetry.
>	Using the curve brush, draw perpendicular to the first edge, press shift before releasing.
>	Repeat for the second edge.




: Create Holes
>	With the SliceCircle brush, create a new polygroup for the hole.
>	Hide and delete that polygroup.
>	Bridge two openings using CurveBridge brush and re-DynaMesh the object. (Don't forget that when using the CurveBridge brush, press Shift to have it automatically draw/close the guide on the opening)




: Create ZRemesherGuide Loops
You want your joints in a specific place, so you create guide loops with ZRemesherGuide brush. The best way of doing this is with CreaseCurve brush. 
>	Turn ON PolyF to see the wire frame.
>	Use CreaseCurve.
>	Stroke menu> Curve Functions; deactivate the Border and Frame Mesh options.




: Group Loops (edgeloop polygroups) then transpose in to center.  delete any remaining artifacts, repolygroup and dynamesh

>	in transpose mode hold alt key to extrude unmasked area.

extrude clean edges using transpose:
>	isolate the area to be extruded.
>	polygroup
>	tool> geometry> edgeloop> groupsLoops. (set number of loops)


: Extrude (ZModeler):
>	hold ctrl to extrude withought new edgeloop and polygroup	
>	hold shift to extrude along normal without adding geometry
>	tap alt after starting a qmesh extrude to change polygrouping




: Insert Edgeloop (ZModeler):
	hold shift to constain new edgeloop to a staight line  *inserting an edgeloop over an existing edgeloop and hitting alt will delete that edge loop

: Align Edge (ZModeler):
	select first edge then click + drag second edge.

: Split (ZModeler):
	inserts a point on the clicked edge and connects it to all adjacent edges. Dragging the point during the Split Action allows you to move it along the edge.
	alt: collapse the edge by welding its two points together at the location of the one closest to the click.


	
	
Equalize (ZModeler):
	evaluate the surface and add geometry to surface that has been stretched and is light on geometry












SCULPTING:    ------------------------------------------------------------------------


techniques:

: Insert Brush         
insert mesh primitives  (keywords: insert brush)
	adjust proportions - hold alt after starting to drag (holding alt before flips normals)
	hight              - controlled by the z intesity slider
	reset proportions  - ctrl

>	control-drag twice on background to merge the two
(loop around mesh by holding shft key after drag)
(delete old curve by clicking model (if IMM brush still active) or stroke> curve functions> delete curve(delete all curves))

http://docs.pixologic.com/user-guide/3d-modeling/nanomesh/
>	m key select subtool or IMM mesh
>	use target option to select placement
>	after placement the nanomesh palette becomes active and the instance can be modified.  (You can delete the geometry the nanomesh was built on after converting to polymesh 3d.)













RETOPOLOGY:    -----------------------------------------------------------------------


: zremesher 
(target polygon count 1 = 1000 polys)




: dynamesh (evenly redistribute poly mesh)
>	geometry> dynamesh
(re-run dynamesh;  ctrl + drag canvas)




: Topology brush (keywords: retopology)
(does not work with subdivision levels. curves cannot be edited beyond extending and deleting (editing can be done however using another curve brush, making sure that Bend is on and completing your edits).
 
	Brush size			controls curve density.
	
	Draw size			controls the thickness of the generated geometry (change brush size before generating). A Draw Size of 1 will generate a mesh with no thickness.
	
	contrain line		hold shift (you can use the Clip Curve combined with masks to align vertices quickly create straight lines.  Mask rectangle over edgeloop\invert mask\clip curve line to straighten (also zmodeler\slide edge to reposition))
	
	generate topology	click support mesh
	delete curve		alt + drag over curve  (This operation will only work if the 	removal curve begins on the model surface. Otherwise you will rotate the model instead.)             
	delete parts of curves that are not quads or tris - alt + drag on mesh surface away from curves




: Remesh and retain details (by freezing subdivision levels)
>	Tool> Geometry> Freeze Subdivisions on the SubTool you would like to retopologize.
(If level one doesn’t have enough polys to maintain the sculpt’s form, choose the subdivision level with the desired silhouette and Del Lower. After which you can return to the highest and Freeze Subdivision Levels)
>	Use ZRemesher with any desired settings.
>	Freeze Subdivisons again. (ZBrush will now recalculate your subdivision levels and project the details onto the new mesh topology)




: Project Mesh Details (from one mesh to another)
>	Tool> SubTool> Duplicate (ctrl + D)
>	Hide all other SubTools, (including the duplicate).
>	Use ZRemesher with any desired settings.
>	Turn on the copy of the SubTool that has the sculpted details (make sure that this SubTool is at the highest subdivision level).
>	(with the remeshed model still selected), Tool> SubTool> Project All (adjust Dist slider).
(repeat until until you have the desired number of subdivision levels.)














TEXTURES:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------


: Create Tiled Noise Texture
>	Set Document> (canvas) width and height to 512/1024/2048 resolution.
>	exit edit mode and the drag geometry to tile into the canvas.
>	re-enter edit mode and scale
>	exit edit mode, hold tilda key, and position geometry.
>	use layers to add more instances of geometry to tile.







POLYPAINT:    ------------------------------------------------------------------------


allows individual polys to be painted
polypaint> colorize




concept painting:
on polyPlane:
>	drag out polyplane primitive. 
>	turn brush rgb channel on. (draw> rgb channel)
>	masking   (masking> mask by color> mask by intensity)(invert mask)
>	move  (move topological)(move curve)


Quicksketch:
